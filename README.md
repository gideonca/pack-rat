# Introduction
  - [x] Bind to a port
  - [x] Respond to PING (PING)
  - [x] Respond to multiple PINGs 
  - [x] Handle concurrent clients (event loop)
  - [ ] Implement the ECHO command (ECHO)
  - [ ] Implement the SET & GET commands (SET & GET)
  - [ ] Expiry (Add PX argument to SET command)

# Lists
  - [ ] Create a list (RPUSH -> Return num elements as RESP int)
  - [ ] Append an element (existing list support for RPUSH)
  - [ ] Append multiple elements 
  - [ ] List elements (positive indexes) (LRANGE w/ start and end index)
  - [ ] List elements (negative indexes) (See above, get abs val)
  - [ ] Prepend elements (LPUSH -> Inserts right to left rather than left to right)
  - [ ] Query list length (LLEN)
  - [ ] Remove an element (LPOP)
  - [ ] Remove multiple elements
  - [ ] Blocking retrieval (BLPOP)
  - [ ] Blocking retrieval with timeout (BLPOP with PX)

# Streams
  - [ ] The TYPE command (TYPE)
  - [ ] Create a stream (XADD - id's are random seq num - current ms)
  - [ ] Validating entry IDs (Verify new id's are greater than the stream top item)
  - [ ] Partially auto-generated IDs 
  - [ ] Fully auto-generated IDs
  - [ ] Query entries from stream (XRANGE - return RESP Array of entries)
  - [ ] Query with - (Return entries from beginning of stream to given id)
  - [ ] Query with + (Retrieve entries from given id to end of stream)
  - [ ] Query single stream using XREAD
  - [ ] Query multiple streams using XREAD
  - [ ] Blocking reads
  - [ ] Blocking reads without timeout
  - [ ] Blocking reads using $
